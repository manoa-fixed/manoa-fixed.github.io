## Milestone 1 

We have three members working on this app: Yuuma, Roman, and Corben. For our first Milestone, we will assign our members individual responsibilities. Each member will specialize in a certain app area. Also for this Milestone, we will start creating rough mock-up webpages to help get a sense of the project.

Member Responsibilites:

* Yuuma : Front-End designer. Codes the visual side of the site. Must have the page look visually appealing.
* Roman : Will incorporate the mapping aspect of the site. Also implement the photo uploading.
* Corben : Back-End engineer. Will manage the database information. Implements Email Notification feature.
